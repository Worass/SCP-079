THIS THING IS NOT MADE BY ME. ALL CREDIT GOES TO THE CREATORS. I AM ONLY RE-POSTING THIS, BECAUSE NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THIS. MADE IN: 1992.

# SCP-079
The computer voice of SCP-079. It can be done through DOSbox. Voice can be transferred ONLY with VBcable to discord.

There are 2 requirements, one of them is optional.
#1:
1. Download VBcable a+b : https://vb-audio.com/Cable/VirtualCables.htm (AFTER YOU INSTALL, YOU WILL HAVE TO RESTART YOUR COMPUTER FULLY)
2. Download DOSbox : https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1 (NO RESTART REQUIRED)
3. Another drive, other than C:/, because I had problems finding my own folder, if I put the files I want to use in C:/.

#2:
1. Download everything from this github, if you want to restart your project. (Only, if you had problems before).
