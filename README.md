THIS THING IS NOT MADE BY ME. ALL CREDIT GOES TO THE CREATORS. I AM ONLY RE-POSTING THIS, BECAUSE NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THIS. MADE IN: 1992.

# SCP-079
The computer voice of SCP-079. It can be done through DOSbox. Voice can be transferred ONLY with VBcable to discord.

There are 2 requirements, one of them is optional.
#1:
1. Download VBcable a+b : https://vb-audio.com/Cable/VirtualCables.htm (AFTER YOU INSTALL, YOU WILL HAVE TO RESTART YOUR COMPUTER FULLY)
2. Download DOSbox : https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1 (NO RESTART REQUIRED)
3. Another drive, other than C:/, because I had problems finding my own folder, if I put the files I want to use in C:/.

#2:
1. Download everything from this github, if you want to restart your project. (Only, if you had problems before).

STEPS:
1. When you download VCcable a+b, restart your computer.
2. After this, download DOSbox from the given link.
3. After you set-up your dosbox, create a folder in your other drive (NOT C:/)
4. Put everything from this github and dosbox to your newly created folder.
5. Drag "SBAITSO2.BAT" onto the "DOSBOX.exe" extension. THE FILE OPENS.

WARNING: You will get no output of the sound, when you will connect this program to discord, unless you find a better way.
STEPS:
1. Press Windows icon
2. Type: Sound mixer > Click
3. Go below, and find "DOSBOX.exe" (it has to be opened with the "SBAITSO2.bat") Press the first box, and press VBcable Input
4. Press the second boxes on both of the discord processes and select VBcable Output.

Done!
Enjoy.
